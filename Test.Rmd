This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Describing a categorical variable**:
tableONI=table(dataidx$ONI)
tableONI

# Using a plot for the categorical:
barplot(tableONI)


# Describing the numerical variables
summary(dataidx[,c(3,4)])

# Using a plot for the numerical:
boxplot(dataidx[,c(3,4)])

## Describing bivariate relationships

# * Numerical and categorical:

boxplot(dataidx$FH~dataidx$Region)

#Boxplots were introduced by Tuckey (Tukey, John W (1977). Exploratory Data Analysis. Addison-Wesley.)
